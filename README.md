# Math Puzzle Rewards

## Project Title
**Math Puzzle Rewards** – A gamified blockchain-based puzzle system where players can solve math puzzles to earn points, upgrade tiers, and receive NFT rewards.

## Project Description
Math Puzzle Rewards is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows players to solve math puzzles and earn points. As players accumulate points, they progress through tiers (from 1 to 3), unlocking unique NFTs as rewards. The smart contract ensures a fair and transparent system by tracking player progress, puzzle attempts, and NFT minting based on performance.

Players can only attempt each puzzle once and must solve it within a specified time limit. The contract owner can add new puzzles and set tier-specific reward metadata (e.g., IPFS URIs) for NFTs minted at each tier.

## Contract Address
0x046423258427f91B6f1DF2ab2ac0677a00205261

## Project Vision
The goal of Math Puzzle Rewards is to merge blockchain technology with gamification. By leveraging the power of NFTs, this project creates an engaging system for players that rewards them for their problem-solving skills. The vision is to create a platform where learning and achievement are incentivized, using blockchain for both transparency and rewards.

Future plans include:
- A wider variety of puzzle types (math, logic, etc.).
- Community-driven puzzle creation and curation.
- Additional game mechanics like leaderboards, challenges, and collaborative solving.

## Key Features
- **Puzzle Solving**: Players can solve math puzzles to earn points, with different difficulty levels offering varying rewards.
- **Tier Progression**: Players progress through 3 tiers based on their accumulated points, unlocking new NFT rewards at each level.
- **NFT Rewards**: Unique ERC721 NFTs are minted for players who achieve higher tiers, with each tier linked to specific IPFS URIs for metadata.
- **Puzzle Management**: The contract owner can add new puzzles with customizable difficulty, time limits, and rewards.
- **Secure & Transparent**: Built with `ReentrancyGuard` for security, ensuring the system is resistant to common attacks.
- **Player Stats**: Tracks player progress, including total points, puzzles solved, and current tier. Players can view their stats and track their journey through the game.

## How to Use
1. **Deploy the contract** on Ethereum or a compatible blockchain network.
2. **Add puzzles** using the `addPuzzle` function (only accessible by the contract owner).
3. **Players solve puzzles** and earn points by submitting answers within the time limit.
4. **Check progress** by viewing stats with `getPlayerStats`.
5. **Tier upgrades**: When players reach specific point thresholds, they automatically receive NFT rewards linked to their tier.

## Requirements
- Ethereum or compatible blockchain network for deployment.
- MetaMask or another Web3 wallet to interact with the contract.
- IPFS for storing tier-related metadata (optional).

## Installation and Usage

To interact with the contract, you'll need:
- A local or testnet Ethereum environment (e.g., Ganache, Rinkeby).
- A Web3 interface (such as Remix, Hardhat, or Truffle) to deploy and interact with the contract.
